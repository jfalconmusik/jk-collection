            <br></br>
            <p>
              The Site may contain links to third-party websites and
              applications of interest, including advertisements and external
              services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used
              these links to leave the Site, any information you provide to
              these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we
              cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information.
              Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party
              websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and
              practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that
              website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your
              discretion, protect the privacy of your information. We are not
              responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and
              policies of any third parties, including other sites, services or
              applications that may be linked to or from the Site.

            <h2>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures
              to help protect your personal information. While we have taken
              reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to
              us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures
              are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission
              can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of
              misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to
              interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we
              cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal
              information.

            <h2>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children
              under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have
              collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the
              contact information provided below.

            <h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a
              Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal
              your privacy preference not to have data about your online
              browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology
              standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
              finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
              signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
              your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
              tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
              inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
              Privacy Policy. Most web browsers and some mobile operating
              systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
              activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
              your online browsing activities monitored and collected. If you
              set the DNT signal on your browser, we will respond to such DNT
              browser signals.

              personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
